# HOMEWORKS

There will be two kinds of homeworks:  
1. Writing chapter summaries, and 
2. Project milestones (please see the project section)

## Instructions for writing chapter summaries:
1. Submit at least a one page summary (at least 500 words) of the chapter.
1. All text must be `in your own words` and anything copied must be quoted and cited appropriately.
1. Use bullets only when appropriate - your summary cannot be all bullets.
1. Don't copy/paste images or equations from the slides or from the Internet - if you do, please cite the source right below the figure or equation.
